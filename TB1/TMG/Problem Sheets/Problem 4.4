$\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{V}(y^2z-x^3-axz^2-bz^3)\subset\mathcal{P}^2, a,b\in\mathbb{C}$ is a projective algebraic curve. I am asked to prove that there are exactly four tangent lines to $\mathcal{C}$ which pass through $p=(0:1:0)$. 

Of course as $p\in\mathcal{C}$ we have that one of them is the tangent at $p$. Then, I try to find points $(q_0,q_1,q_2)$ s.t. $q\in\mathcal{C}$ and $p$ lies in the tangent to $\mathcal{C}$ at $q$. 

This yields $q_1^2q_2-q_0^3-aq_0q_2^2-bq_2^3=0$ and $2q_1q_2y-(aq_2^2+3q_0^2)x-(2aq_0q_2+3bq_2^2-q_1^2)z\mid _{(0:1:0)} = 0 \Rightarrow 2q_1q_2 = 0$

Now, if $q_1=0$ then either $q_2\neq 0$ or $q_0\neq 0$. If it is the first case then w.l.g. we assume $q_2=1$ (which we can due to homogeneity), and we have that $-q_0^3-aq_0-b=0$.

If it is the second case we assume $q_0=1$ and we have $-1-aq_2^2-bq_2^3=0$.

When $q_2=0$ the cases that arise only yield the point $p$, which we already now.

So my question is, given those two final equations, how do I conclude that there are exactly three points $q$ with different tangent lines or even more than three but with coincident tangent lines resulting in a total of three lines (plus the one that is tangent at $p$)? Should I tackle this from a completely different angle or am I on the right path? Thank you very much.
