q17
y=wx+epsilon
the x's are gaussians, a linear mapping of gaussians is gaussian
that means p(y|w)=N()
the mean is (expected value) E[y]=E[wx+epsilon]=E[wx]=0 due to our choice of x
(its distribution has mean zero)
The covariance is E[yy^t]=E[(wx+eps)(wx+eps)^t]=E[wxx^tw]+E[eps*eps^t] the 2nd term
is sigma^2*I, and x*x^t is the identity apparently
so the upper expresssion is ww^t+sigma^2*I
